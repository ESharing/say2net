        	<h4>Instructions for the Stomp Demo</h4>
            <p>This is a simple Stomp demo that illustrates the use of the Kaazing Gateway, Apache ActiveMQ, HTML 5 Web sockets and Server-sent events, and an API-specific JavaScript library implementation of the Stomp protocol. The demo consists of three sections - Login, Subscribe, and Transaction.</p>
              <span class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must have Apache ActiveMQ running in order for this demo to work. Refer to
               the <a href="../documentation/getting-started.html">Getting Started Guide</a> for instructions on how to get Apache ActiveMQ up and running.</span>
			   <ul class="arrow-2">
               <li>Use the first section to log in and connect to a specific service. The demo is configured to use an
               Apache ActiveMQ instance. A user name and password are not required for this demo. The location field indicates
               the  URI that the Kaazing Gateway has been configured to listen on. For example
                 <code>ws://localhost:8000/activemq</code>. The Kaazing Gateway is designed to
               support the HTML 5 WebSocket (<code>ws://</code>) scheme. For more information on how to configure
               Kaazing Gateway, refer to the <a href="../documentation/getting-started.html">Getting Started Guide</a>.</li>
               <li>Use the second section to subscribe to a destination or topic, and then send messages to
               this destination. All clients that are subscribed to the same destination will receive these messages, and you can
               see theirs. You can launch as second browser to see this in action.</li>
               <li>Use the third section  for transactions. You can begin a transaction, send messages to that
               particular transaction and destination. No messages will be broadcasted until you click Commit.
               Alternatively you can  abort the transaction in which case no messages will be broadcasted.</li>

               <span class="note">If you want to see messages sent using a transaction you must first subscribe to the
               destination shown in the destination field for transactions.</span>
               </ul>
            <a name="error"></a><h5>Error Messages</h5>
            <p>If you receive Java exceptions in the message window, don't worry. In many cases this happens when you click Commit or Abort button when there is nothing to commit or abort.
            This causes Apache ActiveMQ to throw an exception. The exception is then sent to
            the Stomp client, which will display the error in the message window.</p>
